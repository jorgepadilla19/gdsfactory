Plugins
===================================

-  Mode solver. Frequency Domain solver to compute modes for different
   waveguide geometries. Single frequency/wavelength solving.

   -  MPB. See ``gdsfactory.simulation.modes``

-  FDTD: Finite difference time domain wave propagation. Provides
   Broadband spectrum for a component. Described as Sparameters (ratio
   of output/input field for each port)

   -  lumerical Ansys FDTD. See ``gdsfactory.simulation.lumerical``
   -  meep. See ``gdsfactory.simulation.gmeep``
   -  tidy3d. See ``gdsfactory.simulation.gtidy``

-  Linear circuit solver
